If we have just a application.properties and we want to switch from profile to profile, it has a problem because when swith for example to qa profile, it already load from the default,
hte order is the following:
1 go to localhost:8888
2 load default properties
3 change to qa profile

in order to solve that we have to add a bootstrap.properties or .yml and pass the url and the profile, the bootstrapt is load first than the application.property so we have
1 go to localhost:8888
2 change profile
1 go to s1rates and load info
